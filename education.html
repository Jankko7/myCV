            <h3>Advertisement Services</h3>
            <p>
              Back in high school, I was attending Advertisement Services classes which included some basic stuff such as mathematics, economics, accounting,
              but the best part for me were graphic design classes. During the 4 years, I dived a lot into Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign and also into the basics of web development. Paradoxically I wasn't interested in web development a lot back in high school but I really liked the graphic design.
              I was trying to succeed in the graphic design field and I also made some money doing it but at some point way after high school, I began tilting
              toward coding more although I knew almost nothing about it, and to be honest I'm still pretty much a learner.

              Although I chose the school just because it was close in my hometown and I didn't really know what I want to do by the end
              of elementary school, I'm glad I made this choice because it kinda opened the world of IT for me.

            <h3>Python Academy by Engeto</h3>
            <p>
              I attended this in-person Python course in 2018. The whole course had 12 lessons, during each lesson we dived into multiple Python topics such as
              syntax, algorithms, debugging.
              Unfortunately, this course was not certified.

            <h3>C++ on Udemy</h3>
            <p>
              Right now I'm mostly taking courses on Udemy.com. So far I've done two C++ courses for beginners and got multiple courses in a stack for the future.
              For now, the courses I've done gave me basic knowledge about C++ syntax (data types, input/output, loops, conditions, classes), algorithms and I also finished a little project with

            <h3>Web Development on Udemy</h3>
            <p>
              Currently, I'm taking an in-depth Web Development course which is by far my most favourite.
              This course includes not only the basics for Web development such as HTML5, CSS3, Javascript but also modern technologies such as JQuery, Node.js, Mongo DB and lot more.
