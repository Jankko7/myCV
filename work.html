        <h3>Facility Support</h3>
        <p>
          MSD IT is the first IT company I work at. I began as a Facility Support here which really was a position that serves to the facility management
          for anything even a little bit technically related. The job workload included managing security software for entry badges and cameras
          (Lenel OnGuard & xProtect CCTV), any furniture logistic, support for videoconference calls and also taking care of storages.

        <h3>Infrastructure Support Specialist</h3>
        <p>
          After one year on the Facility support position, I received an opportunity to become a member of the Infrastructure Support Team. In the first place it was because
          facility and IT support are under contract with Sodexo in MSD so I was kinda moving in a range of Sodexo company here and secondly because
          my colleagues probably knew me a bit after a year in the company, so they could tell I'm able to learn the workload
          fast enough and become a helpful part of the team. This job taught me how to operate Windows and Mac on good level (Windows better than Mac),
          it gave me experience with fixing plenty of issues regarding MS Office software, network, hardware changes,
          remote access, installation of OS or any software really, you name it. It gave me awareness about the server side, active directory, registry, and many more topics.

        <h3>PROJECT: Nanocleansolar</h3>
        <p>
          During my short period on University, I've made friends with a fellow classmate and she had the right contact on a guy, who likes to gives opportunities
          to young people, so he decided to let us make a new web design for one of his web pages. It took us a couple of weeks during the studies and work but eventually
          we delivered a web design for him, which he liked and you can see the <a href="http://www.nanocleansolar.com/en/" target="_blank">RESULT</a> here.
        </p>

        <h3>PROJECT: Beats for love 2018</h3>
        <p>
          I had a contract with DNB market company for creating clothing designs. I and the other graphics were asked through DNB market to create a couple of designs for
          the Beats for love festival. If they would like some of the designs, they would print it on their merchandise and sell it during the festival. In the end
          they liked <a href"" target="_blank">MY DESIGN</a> the most and chose it as a winner, it was the only design delivered from DNB market that was being sold during the festival.
